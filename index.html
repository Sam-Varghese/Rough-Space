        <p class="p2">Marriage is a sacrament, a mystery that involves an initiation in to a new life by two persons. Initiation implies the orientation to participate in the practice of sharing each other's life. True participation involves the love that Christ had for His bride The Church. Marriage relationship at its best is mutual self-giving love. Just as God blessed the first family commanding Adam and Eve to be fruitful and multiply, so the Church gives her blessing to the union of man and woman.

Our Sacrament of Marriage is a blend of biblical traditions, teachings, and practices of the early church in Palestine, Syria and of the ancient customs of South India. The Marriage service is divided into two parts. formerly held separately but now celebrated in immediate succession. The preliminary part is the "Office of Betrothal" (blessing of the rings) and the second part is the "Office of Crowning" (blessing of crowns) which constitutes the sacrament proper.</p>
