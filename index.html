    <hr />

    <p>
      Saturday, January 19, 1952, saw the flowering of the seed sown way back in
      1947, by&nbsp;Mr. Mangulal Jethalal Shah. Mr. B. G. Kher, the then Premier
      of Bombay Province moved a resolution at the First All India Conference
      for the Blind held in Mumbai (formerly Bombay), which led to the founding
      of the National Association for the Blind (India). Six weeks later, with
      an Executive Council of just 19 members and the support of workers and
      sympathizers of the blind, Barrister Rustom Merwanji Alpaiwalla was
      appointed the first President of NAB (India). These determined people then
      began the mission to establish NAB (India), as an icon of boundless
      services for the blind.

    <h2 align="center"><i class="fas fa-chart-line"></i> Activities</h2>

    <hr />

    <p>
      For over four decades, the Home has been a benefactor to several visually
      challenged elderly persons. It offers them all the basic amenities
      absolutely on no cost, and a lifestyle conducive to a healthy mind and
      life. Visually challenged individuals over 55 years of age are admitted
      and are provided free board and lodging, as well as clothing, toiletries,
      footwear, recreational facilities and medical care. A qualified doctor
      attached to the clinic in the Home complex, attends to the medical
      requirements of the aging residents.<br />
      Apart from routine activities like prayer and exercises, residents who are
      in good health and are interested in keeping themselves occupied, are
      involved in activities like weaving, knitting, embroidery, tailoring,
      caning chairs, making decorative candles and incense sticks etc. To foster
      self-sufficiency, they are given pocket money plus commission on the
      various items made individually.<br />
      Apart from these tangible benefits, the Home endeavors to build confidence
      and strengthen their spirit for life, through various cultural and
      recreational activities. Visits to other institutions or places of
      spiritual interest are periodically arranged. The residents are encouraged
      to develop interest in leisure activities like music. They also have their
      own orchestra.<br />
      Today, this homely institution continues to bring happiness and enables 70
      visually challenged individuals – men and women – in their twilight years
      – to live a life of dignity and independence.

    <p>This NGO is open from 10:30AM to 5:30PM.</p>

    <p>
      After having a talk with the owner, and the members of this NGO, I have
      come to know that they are glad to have students visit this NGO, so as to
      inculcate the values like selflessness, helping nature, social service,
      etc in students.
